## Unveiling Trends in Movie Data (2000-2001)

### Business Challenge:

The film industry aims to optimize its performance by creating movies that resonate with audiences and generate substantial revenue. Navigating the diverse landscape of genres, ratings, and lengths poses challenges in determining the most effective approaches. This project dives into movie data obtained from external APIs, which was subsequently organized in an SQL database, to uncover patterns and insights that can inform decision-making.

### Data Source:

APIs such as [IMDb API](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/) were leveraged to fetch comprehensive information about movies, providing a more dynamic and up-to-date dataset. The data was then organized and stored in an SQL database for efficient querying and analysis.

### Data Collection Period:

The data used for this analysis spans from the year 2000 to 2001, providing a snapshot of the film industry during that specific time frame.

### API Integration:

The analysis heavily relies on the integration of external APIs, allowing for real-time updates and a more enriched dataset. This ensures that the analysis is based on the latest and most accurate information available.

**To prepare the data, a cleaning process was performed, followed by Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).**

### Exploratory Data Analysis:

- Visualized histograms and countplots for all columns during EDA, providing insights into various movie statistics.
- Explored the impact of MPAA ratings on revenue and the relationship between movie length and financial success.

##### Mean Rating by Genre

The average ratings of movies across various genres were analyzed to understand the audience's perception of each category. Here are the top genres, ranked by mean rating:

1. **Talk-Show:** 8.25
2. **Biography:** 6.57
3. **Music:** 6.49
4. **History:** 6.37
5. **Musical:** 6.25

These findings provide insights into the genres that tend to receive higher average ratings, reflecting audience preferences based on content and storytelling.

These results complement the overall movie data analysis, offering a comprehensive understanding of both the financial success and audience reception across different genres.

##### Revenue by Genre

The analysis delves into the revenue generated by different movie genres, providing insights into the financial performance of each category. The top genres, ranked by total revenue, are as follows:

1. **History:** $210,601,234.50
2. **Fantasy:** $105,999,670.07
3. **Sci-Fi:** $103,452,691.92
4. **Comedy:** $100,810,512.36
5. **Animation:** $64,438,521.25

These results highlight the genres that have historically performed well in terms of revenue.

- **Results:** "History" emerged with the highest total revenue.

#### Data Cleaning and Formatting

- Dropped duplicates, created new columns, and formatted revenue values for clarity.

### Conclusion:

This analysis, based on real-time data from external APIs, subsequently organized in an SQL database, spans from the year 2000 to 2001. It provides valuable insights into the factors influencing movie revenue and ratings. The Jupyter Notebook contains detailed code and visualizations, serving as a valuable resource for future decision-making in the film industry.
